Problem Link : https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-the-closest-pair-from-two-arrays4215/1

Problem Statement : Given two sorted arrays and a number x, find the pair whose sum is closest to x and the pair has an element from each array. In the case of multiple closest pairs return any one of them.
Note: The output represents the closest difference of the sum with the number x.

Solution : 

```
class Solution{
  public:
    vector<int> printClosest(int arr[], int brr[], int n, int m, int x) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = m-1;
        int first = -1;
        int second = -1;
        int diff = INT_MAX;
        while(i < n && j >=0){
            int sum = arr[i] + brr[j];
            if(abs(sum - x) < diff){
                diff = abs(sum - x);
                first = arr[i];
                second = brr[j];
            }
            if(sum > x){
                j--;
            }
            else if(sum <= x){
                i++;
            }
        }
        // cout << diff << endl;
        return {first,second};
    }
};
